[Licensing]
The unofficial toolset uses third-part code:
 - OPCODE 1.3 (http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm)
 - Most matrix/quaternion methods are taken from
   Game Programming Gems (http://www.graphicsgems.org),
   WildMagic library (http://www.geometrictools.com),
   LightWave 8.0 SDK and ik2Bsolver sample from Maya 8.5 SDK.
 - lzhuf.c (Haruyasu Yoshizaki)
 - minilzo library (http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/)
 - CRC32 (Gary S. Brown)
 - (more?)

Also it uses the .dds library from NVIDIA. The code to load/save
X-Ray files closely follows the GSC one.

Regarding the rest source code, you can do whatever you want, just do
not say you wrote it. Please include this notice and all the source
code when distributing the binaries.
